# Indian-Roads
An android application that detects objects normally found on indian roads like - Car, Bicycle, Cow, Truck, etc. I used TF-Lite model in this application, and downloaded specific categories from COCO dataset to train upon. The application uses phones rear camera and detects in real time.
